His mutant abilities first manifest when he kills Thomas in retaliation after Thomas murders James' supposed father, John Howlett. Fleeing with his childhood companion Rose, James adopts the name Logan and grows up in the Yukon. He develops animal-like senses, enhanced physical abilities, and a powerful healing factor. After accidentally killing Rose, he lives in the wilderness among wolves before being captured and later escaping from a secret program where his skeleton is fused with the indestructible metal adamantium. Throughout his life, Logan serves in various military and covert operations, including World War I and II, and experiences memory loss due to trauma and experimentation. He is known for his gruff, brooding nature and fierce combat skills, often struggling with berserker rage while being a skilled strategist and martial artist."

Orphaned at a young age, he was raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben. During a science exhibit, Peter is bitten by a radioactive spider, which grants him spider-like abilities such as enhanced strength, agility, the ability to cling to surfaces, and a precognitive \"spider-sense\" that warns him of danger. Using his scientific skills, he creates web-shooters that allow him to fire adhesive webs. Initially, Peter uses his powers for personal gain and fame, but after a criminal he once ignored kills his Uncle Ben, Peter learns the crucial lesson that \"with great power there must also come great responsibility.\" This event motivates him to become a crime-fighter known as Spider-Man, balancing his life as a student and superhero."

To help her control her abilities, Charles Xavier placed psychic blocks on her mind during her youth, allowing her to initially use only telekinesis. Later, she joined Xavier's school for gifted youngsters and became a founding member of the X-Men under the codename Marvel Girl.\nJean is known for her caring and nurturing nature but also for her immense power as an Omega-level mutant. She is famously connected to the cosmic Phoenix Force, which amplifies her abilities to god-like levels, enabling her to manipulate matter and energy on a vast scale. This connection has led to significant transformations in her character, including becoming the Phoenix and later the Dark Phoenix, during which she struggled with immense power and its consequences. Despite these challenges, Jean remains a central figure who balances her humanity with her extraordinary powers, often sacrificing herself to protect others."

His mother is the shapeshifter Mystique, and his father is the mutant Azazel, though his true parentage was hidden for many years. Due to his blue skin, pointed ears, yellow eyes, and a prehensile tail, Kurt was abandoned as an infant and later found and raised by the sorceress Margali Szardos, who took him in as her own alongside her children at a circus. Growing up, Kurt became an acrobat, cherished by the circus community despite his unusual appearance. His ability to teleport emerged during adolescence, adding to his already remarkable agility. Nightcrawler\u2019s early life was marked by tragedy: he accidentally killed his foster brother Stefan, fulfilling a childhood promise to stop him if he ever harmed innocents. Wrongly blamed for a series of murders, Kurt fled from angry villagers, setting the stage for his future as a heroic outcast."

Thor wields the enchanted hammer Mjolnir, which grants him control over thunder, lightning, and flight, and can only be lifted by those deemed worthy. Known for his immense strength and extended lifespan, Thor has taken on various human identities, including the physician Donald Blake, through whom he initially experienced life on Earth without memory of his divine origins. His story includes battles against numerous foes, including his adoptive brother Loki, and alliances with other heroes. Thor has also served as a king of Asgard and has a close circle of allies such as Sif and the Warriors Three. His character is inspired by the Norse god of the same name, blending mythological elements with heroic adventures."

Abandoned as a child due to his small and weak stature for a Frost Giant, he was found and adopted by Odin, the ruler of Asgard, and raised alongside Odin's son Thor. Despite being raised as a prince, Loki struggled with feelings of jealousy and resentment toward Thor, who was favored for his strength and bravery\u2014qualities Loki lacked. To compensate, Loki became highly skilled in magic and sorcery, earning the title \"God of Mischief\" for his cunning, trickery, and mastery of magical powers such as shapeshifting, illusion casting, and teleportation. His mischievous nature eventually turned to malice as he sought to claim the throne of Asgard, often plotting against Thor and others. Though primarily portrayed as a villain, Loki has also acted as an antihero when it suited his interests.

During her coma, she was subjected to clandestine experimental procedures that granted her superhuman abilities including strength, resilience, and flight. After waking, she was adopted by the Jones family and returned to school, where she faced ostracism. Discovering her powers, she initially took on the superhero alias \"Jewel\" and fought crime, but after traumatic experiences, including mind control by a villain, she gave up the superhero life. She later became a private investigator, using her abilities and street smarts to solve cases while grappling with her past trauma and complex relationships. Jessica is known for her brawling fighting style and reluctance to embrace the traditional superhero role, preferring to work alone or with a small circle of allies."

Deeply affected by this tragedy and frustrated by the failure of the justice system to prosecute the killers, Castle wages a one-man war on crime using lethal force and a brutal brand of justice. He is highly skilled in hand-to-hand combat, guerrilla warfare, and marksmanship, and is recognized by the iconic skull emblem on his chest, which originated from a symbol worn by an enemy soldier he killed during his military service. Castle's background includes multiple tours of duty as a Marine Scout/Sniper, and his stories often explore themes of vengeance, justice, and the moral complexities of vigilantism. He operates primarily in New York City and is known for his uncompromising stance against criminals, often crossing paths with other heroes but maintaining his role as an antihero."

Gifted with exceptional scientific intellect, he earned a scholarship to study in the United States, where he met and rivaled Reed Richards. An experiment to contact his deceased mother went wrong, leaving Victor's face scarred and leading to his expulsion. He then traveled to Tibet, where he mastered mystical disciplines and had a suit of armor and iron mask forged to hide his disfigurement. Returning to Latveria, he overthrew the monarchy and became its ruler. Combining his mastery of science and sorcery, Doctor Doom seeks global domination, the rescue of his mother\u2019s soul, and to prove his superiority over Reed Richards."
