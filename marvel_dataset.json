During a science exhibit, Peter is bitten by a radioactive spider, which grants him spider-like abilities such as enhanced strength, agility, the ability to cling to surfaces, and a precognitive \"spider-sense\" that warns him of danger. Using his scientific skills, he creates web-shooters that allow him to fire adhesive webs. Initially, Peter uses his powers for personal gain and fame, but after a criminal he once ignored kills his Uncle Ben, Peter learns the crucial lesson that \"with great power there must also come great responsibility.\" This event motivates him to become a crime-fighter known as Spider-Man, balancing his life as a student and superhero."

Deeply affected by this tragedy and frustrated by the failure of the justice system to prosecute the killers, Castle wages a one-man war on crime using lethal force and a brutal brand of justice. He is highly skilled in hand-to-hand combat, guerrilla warfare, and marksmanship, and is recognized by the iconic skull emblem on his chest, which originated from a symbol worn by an enemy soldier he killed during his military service. Castle's background includes multiple tours of duty as a Marine Scout/Sniper, and his stories often explore themes of vengeance, justice, and the moral complexities of vigilantism. He operates primarily in New York City and is known for his uncompromising stance against criminals, often crossing paths with other heroes but maintaining his role as an antihero."

      "text_snippet": "Carnage is a supervillain born from the bonding of an alien symbiote offspring with Cletus Kasady, a psychopathic serial killer. Kasady was originally incarcerated for multiple murders and shared a cell with Eddie Brock, the host of the Venom symbiote. When Venom escaped prison, it left behind its offspring, which then bonded with Kasady, creating Carnage. This new symbiotic entity is far more violent and powerful than Venom due to the stronger bond with Kasady and the symbiote's biology. Carnage embarks on a murderous spree, marked by his signature of writing \"Carnage\" in blood at crime scenes. The character is known for his chaotic and brutal nature, making him a deadly and nightmarish menace."
